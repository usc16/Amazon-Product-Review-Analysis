Developed an automated review system by analyzing sentiment on 21,000+ reviews using feature extraction techniques such as Bag of Words and TF-IDF. Employed various ML models and identified that Logistic Regression achieved the highest F1 score of 0.93 for classifying reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. 

Segmented products and customers into three categories using K-means and Hierarchical clustering techniques.Of the 1,212 unique products analyzed, 32% were labeled as "Best Products", 41% as "Good Products", and 27% as "Average Products" based on their polarity and ratings.

Of the 3,803 unique reviewers, 28% were Highly Satisfied with Amazon products, 52% were Satisfied, and 20% were Dissatisfied.Feedback analysis and discount coupons should be given to the Satisfied and Dissatisfied customer segments to prevent churn.
